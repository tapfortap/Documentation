#Tap for Tap - Paid Promotion

Paid promotion allows you to buy traffic for your app and get more users.  We require that you have our SDK implemented and your app added to Tap for Tap before proceeding.  For more information on how to do this, see our [guide to getting started](GettingStarted).

Once you have Tap for Tap properly integrated into your app you can opt in to our paid promotion program. We have 3 different types of programs for you to chose from CPI, CPC and CPM.

## Bid System

Tap for Tap uses a competitive bid system, so the more you pay the more traffic you receive. We also take into account the performance of your app (TTR/CR*) and the quality of your app (user ratings/Tap exchange participation).

* TTR: Tap through rate, CR: Conversion rate

## Promotion Banners

The banners for promoting your app are the same for the paid promotion and tap exchange.  To read about improving your banner performance, check out our [banner and creative guidelines](CreativeGuidelines).

## Paid Promotion Types

**CPI:** Cost per install. Pay for successful installs of your app by an interested user.

**CPC:** Cost per click. Pay every time a user taps your app’s ad to engage with your app.

**CPM:** Cost per thousand impressions. Pay for every 1000 times your ad is seen.

## Picking a Type

It is up to you what kind of program you chose.  You might get a bit more promotion with CPC and especially CPM since it is easier for us to optimize those types. The reason for this is it takes a while before the Tap for Tap system can estimate how well a CPI promotion type performs on our network. A lot of traffic is used from our developers trying to make money, so we want to be sure it is put to good use. If you are unsure which type to use, we recommend CPC.

If your app is not a free one, we do not allow for CPI. Paid apps can have very poor conversion rates, and we want to ensure the best performance for our developers trying to make money.

## Country Targeting

There are benefits and disadvantages to using country targeting. You can chose to target countries you want to promote to, this uses the same settings as the Tap Exchange.  If you do target countries, the minimum cost to targeting can vary, based on that [country tier](CountryTiers) the country is in.  We want to make sure our developers are earning revenue proportional to the quality and paid promotion competitiveness of the traffic their app provides. If you do not wish to use our country targeting, the minimum cost to doing to is significantly lower but you will receive traffic from all countries on the Tap for Tap network.

## Spend Limit

The daily spend limit can ensure you don’t spend all your balance at once. We have a minimum limitation if you wish to use our program ($10). If you leave this option blank it will not use a spend limit.

If you are using our [monetization program](Monetization) as well as paying for promotion we recommend you do not use a spend limit so all of your revenue can contribute to growing your app.
