# What's New

Version 4.0 of Tap for Tap SDK is available for download on our site or under your management dashboard. We’ve packed a bunch of new features into this update that we know you’ll enjoy. SDKv4.0 is all about taking your monetization efforts to the next level with better ads, smarter placements, and new advertising partners!  Here is a look inside:

* Support for MRAID & VAST Compliant Interstitials and Banners
  * _Video. Dynamic. Static. You can have it all!_

*  Moments- Based Ad Placements (Reward, Rescue, Break)
  * _Ads that integrate seamlessly with the in-app experience & increase user engagement!_

* Smart Pre-Caching for no Lag Time 
  * _Ads load lightning fast!_

Of course, you will still be able to tap into a steady stream of virtually free new users through our Tap Exchange and Cross Promotion platforms, as well as grow your audience with Paid Promotion. Our little extra effort polishes our Monetization platform so you can benefit from the latest innovations in mobile advertising. 

Here’s a little more detail about  the moments in your apps that you can now capitalize on:
