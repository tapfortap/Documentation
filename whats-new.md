# What's New

Version 4.0 of Tap for Tap SDK has arrived! We’ve packed a bunch of new features into this update that we know you’ll enjoy. SDK V4.0 is all about taking your monetization efforts to the next level with better ads, smarter placements, and new advertising partners!  Here is a look inside:

* Support for MRAID & VAST Compliant Interstitials and Banners
  * Video. Dynamic. Static. You can have it all!

*  Moments- Based Ad Placements (Reward, Rescue, Break)
  * Ads that integrate seamlessly with the in-app experience & increase user engagement!

* Smart Pre-Caching for no Lag Time

Of course, you will still be able to tap into a steady stream of virtually free new users through our [Tap Exchange](/doc/get-users/tap-exchange) and [Cross Promotion](/doc/get-users/cross-promotion) platforms, as well as grow your audience with [Paid Promotion](/doc/get-users/paid-promotion). Our little extra effort polishes our [Monetization](/doc/make-money/monetization-network) platform so you can benefit from the latest innovations in mobile advertising. 

Here’s a little more detail about  the moments in your apps that you can now capitalize on:
