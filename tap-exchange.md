# Tap For Tap - Tap Exchange

Tap for Tap allows you to choose how you’d like to be compensated for the ads that you show.

Tap for Tap allows you to split your traffic into two parts, the tap exchange and monetization.  The tap exchange allows you to grow your apps user base for free by exchanging taps generated on the ads you display.

## SDK Implementation

To take park in the tap exchange, you must integrate our SDK. For more information on how to do this, see our [guide to getting started](/doc/getting-started).

## Promotion Banners

The banners for promoting your app are the same for the paid promotion and tap exchange.  To read about improving your banner performance, check out our [banner and creative guidelines](/doc/performance/creatives).

## Revenue Preference

Your account wide revenue preference setting determines how much of your traffic gets divided into our tap exchange and the monetization program.

You can move the slider more to the left if you want to focus on users, or move the slider more to the right for more focus on making money. If your app is new, or if you want to focus on growth, we recommend moving the slider more left to prioritize showing tap exchange ads. We recommend a split of 20% Get Users and 80% Make Money for optimal performance.  This will allow you to have a constant flow of new users from the Tap Exchange while using 80% of your inventory to monetize those users.

## Exchange Tap Credits

Tap credits are the currency for the tap exchange.  By showing tap exchange ads on your app you are promoting other developers on Tap for Tap. Every time one of your apps’ users taps a tap exchange ad, you earn tap credits.

You can then spend those tap credits on placing your apps’ ads on other peoples ads, until you have spend the same amount of tap credits. The amount of tap credits you receive on a tap is directly related to the country the user that tapped on the ad is from. The countries are grouped into [tiers](/doc/country-tiers), and the tap value is assigned to that tier.

## Country Targeting

Tap for Tap allows you to limit which countries your app gets displayed on.  This can be important if you only do business in select countries.

![Country Targeting](https://raw.github.com/tapfortap/Documentation/master/images/world-target.png)

There is an extra tap credit cost with targeting countries. You can see what the extra cost is here.  The reason for this is to promote balance on the network.  If everyone chose to target specific countries, the network would break down. Our goal is to send you taps of the same value that you have sent with our matching system. If your app mainly consists of users from a specific country would probably receive a lot of traffic from that same country back without targeting.

## Matching System

Tap for Taps goal is to ensure developers are receiving the same value they send to other developers. When you gain tap credits by sending taps, we examine a lot of information about that tap to ensure you will get the same value back. Some aspects we look at are:

- User demographics like language and location
- [Ad unit](/doc/ad-units) type and placement
- Information about the app (quality rating and category)
- Overall performance of the users seeing and tapping on ads displayed in your app.

If you spend time ensuring quality ad placements and performance you will generally achieve better results. Trying to get more taps by placing ads in areas likely to be accidentally tapped will result in much lower quality taps being send back.

## Reporting

On the Tap Exchange this breaks down as Earned and Spent metrics. Earned impressions, taps and credits come from the the ads you show as a publisher on Tap for Tap. If you show 1000 impressions of Tap Exchange ads, get 10 taps on the ads in your app (from a tier 1 country) it means you've "Earned" 400 credits.

Spent metrics indicate what Tap for Tap has given you as an advertiser when you spend your tap credits. If you spend your 400 tap credits, we'll show impressions of an ad for your app as many times as it takes for you to get 400 taps credits' worth of taps from new users. Spent Installs refers to the number of new installs those taps have generated.
