Still need help? Check out these frequently asked questions for assistance:

### How does Tap for Tap make money?

We take 20% of the impressions on the exchange. We monetize this inventory by partnering with large publishers who pay us per install (CPI), click (CPC) or impression (CPM).

### Do I have to install the SDK to be part of the Tap Exchange?

Yes, SDK installation is mandatory. We offer a free service that really helps developers. If you want to be part of the community, you have to install the SDK in every app that's on the Tap Exchange. This ensures that our tracking is accurate and that we can monitor quality and keep things fair and valuable for all members of Tap for Tap.

### What's the difference between a tap exchange and an impression exchange?

An impression exchange only exchanges ad views. If you host 1000 ads on your app, you get your ads shown 1000 times (or equivalent) on other apps. A tap exchange, on the other hand, exchanges taps/clicks. If the ads you host on your apps are tapped 1000 times, you are guaranteed 1000 equivalent taps of your own ads.

### So if I earn a tap credit, you'll show my ad however many times it takes to earn a tap for my app?

Exactly, it's all in our name! The algorithm that the network is based on is designed to generate taps as efficiently as possible.

### Do taps from varying countries have varying values associated with them?

Yes. We assign each country a tier 1-4. These tiers can be found here. The taps you generate will all earn the corresponding value. Likewise, when you spend, you will be charged the corresponding value for countries the taps come from.

### Do you support geo-targeting? How does it work?

Yes we do. When you setup your campaign, you can select which countries you'd like to target your tap credits on. You'll be charged the credit value of that country's tier, plus a targeting fee that is specific to the country. We feel geo-targeting is important for developers, but we need to charge more for targeting because we are an exchange and heavily targeted traffic can put stress on the exchange. This is why a premium is necessary.

### What platforms do you support?

Tap for Tap is available for iOS and Android platforms.

### Do you support tablets? What about tablet only apps?

Yes, our ad unit’s work for mobile apps viewed on a tablet device.   Interstitials look great and they have the best eCPM out of all ad units so we recommend that you use them.  Banners will still look small and the look isn't ideal. We are working on adding banners sizes that fit on tablets this component and it will be release in V3.1 will let you know as soon as it's ready. 

### What are the different banner sizes? Where can I select these?

We offer a banner (640x100), interstitial (640x960 Portrait and 960x640 Landscape) and an app wall. More information about these ad units can be found here. 

### Are you able to integrate with other ad mediation layers (I.E Admob/iAds)?

If you'd like to integrate another ad mediation layer then the best solution for showing multiple ad partners along with Tap for Tap is to use Ad Mob's Ad Whirl, adding Tap for Tap as a custom event. Instructions are here.

### What do you Track? Taps? Installs?

Yes, we track impressions, taps and installs. You'll find these in the reporting interface in your account. You can also see traffic by country broken down. You can see where your own traffic is coming from, as well as the traffic you're purchasing with Tap Credits.

### Can I use tap for tap to earn on one app, but then promote another?

This is exactly what Tap for Tap was designed for. Many developers are using this strategy to good effect. Use a popular app to earn credits to promote a new app, use your free app to earn and then broadcast your paid app on our network. Earn on iOS and promote your new Android App on Tap for Tap. It's important to note that Tap for Tap requires that both apps have our SDK integrated in order to provide our developers with install tracking and improved analytics.

### Do Tap for Tap ads automatically refresh?

### What currency does Tap for Tap use?

Tap for Tap uses the USD currency, which is displayed as your balance, and used for all incoming and outgoing transfers.

### Why am I showing Tap Exchange ads when I have 100% monetization selected, or vice versa?

If you have 100% monetization selected, you still might show a Tap Exchange ad, if we don’t have a monetization ad to show for that impression. It could be because the impression is from a region that we don’t have advertiser demand in. If you’d prefer that Tap for Tap not show any Tap Exchange ads when we don’t have a monetization ad to show, you can select this setting in your Account Settings.

### Why do I have clicks, but no revenue earned on the Monetization network?

Most of Tap for Tap’s advertisers work on a CPI basis, so this is why you might have taps showing in your statistics but no revenue.
