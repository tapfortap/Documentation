# SDK FAQ

#### Q. Do you require the `READ_PHONE_STATE_PERMISSION`?
**A.** Yes SDK 3.x requires the `READ_PHONE_STATE_PERMISSION`. It helps to improve both install tacking and monetization offers. If you do not want to use this permission you can still use [SDK 2.x](https://github.com/tapfortap/SDK/archive/2.x-final.zip).

#### Q. Why is the app wall so small when shown in landscape on a phone?
**A.** The app wall is designed to be shown in portrait on phones, not in landscape. In this situation you are better off showing an interstitial instead.
