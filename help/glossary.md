# Tap for Tap - Glossary

## Reporting

Reporting refers to the statistics related to the Tap Exchange, Paid Promotion and Monetization components of Tap for Tap. Reporting allows you to see in depth stats reports about the impressions, taps and installs you’re generating for your app, as well as how much you’re spending on ads for your app and earning from showing ads in your app.

## Fill Rate

Fill rate refers the percentage of ads requests that are filled with actual ads. Most ad networks do not have 100% fill rates, because there are instances where they run out of advertisers to show, or may not have a suitable advertiser to show for an ad request. Because Tap for Tap has both a Tap Exchange and a Monetization Platform that work together, we will always be able to show an ad for one or the other, so Tap for Tap is the only network that can claim to have a 100% fill rate.
