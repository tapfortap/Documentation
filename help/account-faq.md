# Account FAQ

#### Q. I integrated the sdk but why can I not see any ads?
**A.** For Android, double check that you have added all the required permissions and activities. For iOS double check that you have added the required frameworks. If you are still not able to see ads, try waiting 30 mins and try again. If you are still having problems please email support@tapfortap.com.

#### Q. My app was approved by the store but I can’t see my app name in my account?
**A.** The app name will appear once the app hits 10 unique devices (different IP addresses). We do this to ensure there are no fraudulent taps occurring. 

#### Q. Can credits be converted into money?
**A.** Credits cannot be converted into money nor do they have any connection.

#### Q. If I request a withdrawal how long until I receive the funds? is there a minimum? 
**A.** We pay on a net7 monthly basis, which means if you request payment at any time in the month of October, you will be paid on the 7th of November.
#### Q. Why am I seeing clicks generated through monetization but no money?
**A.** This is because some of our monetization offers are cost per install, so you only get paid on a successful install. Tap for Tap records installs when a user opens the app, so occasionally these installs can be delayed.

#### Q. What are custom ad units and why should I consider them?
**A.** If you have your own ad units already you can upload them through the banner creation page on your account. Custom ad units are a great tool to gain exposure and are key in separating yourself from the group.

#### Q. Where can I see the 5000 free views? 
**A.** The 5000 views are given to all developers once their first app goes live with our sdk. We do not show the total in your account page but you can see them spent in your reporting. Do not confuse views as credits. 

#### Q. Do these 5000 views mean 5000 credits?
**A.** No, a view is an impression of your ad. A credit means a tap. 5000 credits mean your ad will be shown 5000 times, or 5000 impressions.

#### Q. If I delete my app is it gone forever? 
**A.** The app is not gone forever. You can simply re-integrate the app with your API key.

#### Q. Where can I find my API key? Do I need a different API key if I want to add more apps?
**A.** The API key is located on your account page under the tab “Account”. Tap for Tap has made integrating with our service as easy as possible. Developers can use the same API key for all their apps. 

#### Q. Is there a minimum amount for depositing/withdrawing funds?
**A.** Tap for Tap has a minimum deposit of $20 and a minimum of $25 for a withdrawal.

#### Q. What if Paypal is not supported where I live. Can I still deposit and withdraw funds?
**A.** Currently we only support Paypal. If you wish to deposit/withdraw funds without Paypal please contact support@tapfortap.com to see what options we can offer.

#### Q. What is the best way to get in contact with one of the Tap for Tap team members?
**A.** The best and most efficient way of contacting us is by emailing support@tapfortap.com and we will answer your questions accordingly.

#### Q. What if I find a bug in the Tap for Tap SDK?
**A.** If you find a bug in the SDK please report it to: Android - https://github.com/tapfortap/Android
iOS - https://github.com/tapfortap/iOS

#### Q. Do I have the ability to keep ads for mature or rude or dating apps out of my apps?
**A.** Yes. You have to do this on an individual app basis. Go to your app list and select the app that you wish block content from. Look under “Content Preferences” and simply uncheck the boxes to opt out of each category. Tap for Tap understands the importance of having the ability to flag mature ads so please let us know if you need any assistance with this.

#### Q. Do I have the ability to pick what ads appear in my app?
**A.** Currently you cannot pick and choose what ads appear but if you are unwilling/unhappy to have a certain ad appear in the app then please email support@tapfortap.com and ask us to blacklist that ad for you. 

#### Q. Where is the CPI option for paid promotion campaigns?
**A.** Tap for Tap only offers on a CPM or CPC basis. 

#### Q. Is Tap for Tap 100% free to use?
**A.** It’s free to sign up and serve ads on the Tap Exchange, Monetization, and Self Promotion. The only time you will need to spend money on Tap for Tap is when you decide to run a campaign (CPC or CPM). 

#### Q. How does Tap for Tap make money?
**A.** On the tap exchange we take 20% of the impressions. We monetize this inventory by partnering with large publishers who pay us per install (CPI), tap (CPC) or impression (CPM). On the monetization side, we take a portion of the ad revenue. 

#### Q. What is the new Earning Preference slider on my account?
**A.**  Earning Preference is the setting on Tap for Tap that allows us to add a new dimension to Tap for Tap. Our tap exchange will continue to function as normal but we've added in a more traditional ad network component to Tap for Tap. With the Earning Preference setting, you can select how you want to be paid for the ads you show. Select Get Users if you want to show ads for other tap exchange apps and earn credits for every tap so you can get taps and installs of your app. Select Make Money if you'd like to show ads for sponsored apps, brands and mobile web campaigns if you'd like to earn revenue. 

#### Q. Do I have to install the SDK to be part of the Tap for Tap? 
**A.** Yes, SDK installation is mandatory. We offer a free service that helps developers. If you want to be part of the community, you have to install the SDK in every app on the Tap Exchange. This ensures that our tracking is accurate and that we can monitor quality and keep things fair and valuable for all members of Tap for Tap. 

#### Q. So if I earn a tap credit, you'll show my ad however many times it takes to earn a tap for my app? 
**A.** Exactly, it's all in our name! The algorithm that the network is based on is designed to generate taps as efficiently as possible. 

#### Q. Do taps from varying countries have varying values associated with them? 
**A.**  Yes. We assign each country a tier from 1 to 4 (tier list). The taps you generate earn credits based on the tier of the tapper's country. Likewise, when you spend you are charged the corresponding number of credits based on the tapper's country. 

#### Q. Do you support geo targeting? How does it work? 
**A.**  Yes we do. When you set up your campaign on the tap exchange or the paid promotion network, you can select which countries you'd like to target your credits or dollars on. On the tap exchange you'll be charged the credit value of that country's tier, plus a targeting fee that is specific to the country. We feel geo-targeting is important for developers, but we need to charge more for targeting because we are an exchange and heavily targeted traffic can put stress on the exchange. This is why a premium is necessary. On the paid promotion side, each country tier has a minimum bid. You can bid anything at or above this minimum. The paid side is an auction system, so the higher you bid on traffic, they more likely you are to get the traffic you'd like. 

#### Q. What platforms do you support? 
**A.**  Tap for Tap is available for iOS and Android. 

#### Q. What are the different banner sizes? Where can I select these? 
**A.** We offer banners (640x100), interstitials (640x960 or 960x640), and app walls which are full screen.

#### Q. Are you able to integrate with other ad mediation layers (e.g. AdMob)? 
**A.** Yes, integration with AdMob is easy. Have a look at our AdMob integration documenation. We also work with MoPub and AdWhirl, but AdWhirl is deprecated an not recommended for new apps. 

#### Q. What do you track? Taps? Installs? 
**A.**Yes, we track impressions, taps and installs. You'll find these in the reporting interface in your account. You can also see traffic by country broken down. You can see where your own traffic is coming from, as well as the traffic you're purchasing with credits. 

#### Q. Can I use Tap for Tap to earn credits on one app, but then promote another? 
**A.** This is exactly what Tap for Tap's tap exchange was designed for. Many developers are using this strategy to good effect. Use a popular app to earn credits to promote a new app, use your free app to earn and then broadcast your paid app on our network. Earn on iOS and promote your new Android App on Tap for Tap. It's important to note that Tap for Tap requires that both apps have our SDK integrated in order to provide our developers with install tracking and improved analytics

#### Q. Does Tap for Tap support Unity/Titanium/Corona/Game Salad/PhoneGap? 
**A.** We currently support a number of these platforms (that run on iOS and Android) and have instructions for integrating Tap for Tap on them. If you'd like to request a plugin please contact us and we'll consider supporting other popular platforms. 

#### Q. Do Tap for Tap ads automatically refresh? 
**A.** Yes, Tap for Taps ads automatically refresh between 30 seconds and 2 minutes. 

#### Q. What is your fill rate? 
**A.** Because we are a Tap Exchange and a monetization ad network our fill rate is 100%. Every ad view that you generate as a app host, you'll have the chance to generate tap credits or revenue (depending on your earning preference). 

#### Q. Will Tap for Tap cover up the tab bar in my iphone app? 
**A.** You can position tap for tap anywhere you'd like in your app. With our variety of banner sizes, Tap for Tap can fit within every app.

#### Q. What currency does Tap for Tap use? 
**A.**  Tap for Tap uses the USD currency, which is displayed as your balance, and used for all incoming and outgoing transfers. 

#### Q. Why am I showing Tap Exchange ads when I have 100% monetization selected, or vice versa? 
**A.** If you have 100% monetization selected, you still might show a Tap Exchange ad, if we don't have a monetization ad to show for that impression. It could be because the impression is from a region that we don't have advertiser demand in. If you'd prefer that Tap for Tap not show any Tap Exchange ads when we don't have a monetization ad to show, you can select this setting in your Account Settings.
