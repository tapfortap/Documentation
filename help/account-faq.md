# Account FAQ

#### Q. I integrated the sdk but why can I not see any ads?
**A.** The app needs to be republished to the store and approved with Tap for Tap’s SDK integrated. Once approved the ads should appear. If not, please contact support@tapfortap.com and we will help asap.

#### Q. My app was approved by the store but I can’t see my app name in my account?
**A.** The app name will appear once the app hits 10 unique devices (different IP addresses). We do this to ensure there are no fraudulent taps occurring. 

#### Q. Can credits be converted into money?
**A.** Credits cannot be converted into money nor do they have any connection.

#### Q. If I request a withdrawal how long until I receive the funds? is there a minimum? 

#### Q. Why am I seeing clicks generated through monetization but no money?
**A.** This is a result of you trying to monetize on a CPI offer. However, since Tap for Tap only records an install when the app is opened for the first time. You may see funds appear on a later date.

#### Q. What are custom ad units and why should I consider them?
**A.** If you have your own ad units already you can upload them through the banner creation page on your account. Custom ad units are a great tool to gain exposure and are key in separating yourself from the group.

#### Q. Where can I see the 5000 free views? (side note: we should make it clear they are views and not credits. This was a very common question)
**A.** The 5000 views are given to all developers once their first app goes live with our sdk. We do not show the total in your account page but you can see them spent in your reporting. Do not confuse views as credits. 

#### Q. If I delete my app is it gone forever? 
**A.** The app is not gone forever. You can simply re-integrate the app with your API key.

#### Q. Where can I find my API key? Do I need a different API key if I want to add more apps?
**A.** The API key is located on your account page under the tab “Account”. Tap for Tap has made integrating with our service as easy as possible. Developers can use the same API key for all their apps.

**A.** Tap for Tap has a minimum deposit of $20 and a minimum of $25 for a withdrawal.
