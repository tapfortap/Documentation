# Ad Units

Install Tap for Tap's simple, unified SDK and select your optimum way to exchange taps and generate free installs. Create a banner using Tap for Tap's wizard, or upload your own custom banner. Custom banners are recommended.

## Banners

Banners are the most basic kind of ad and can be shown on the top or bottom of any screen within your app. If you have the real estate on your app, show banners to earn maximum tap credits.  The banner size is 640x100.

## Interstitials

Interstitials are usually the highest performing unit on ad networks. Best practices for interstitials are to show them upon startup of your app, or between levels and actions taken in your app.  The interstital sizes are 640x960 (Portrait) and 960x640 (landscape).

## App Walls

App Walls are a popular ad type that allows you to integrate a "More Apps" button anywhere within the design of your app. Once tapped, this unit will launch an app wall containing ads for other apps on our exchange. App walls are perceived by users as an app discovery feature, rather than an ad, so app walls can be used on any kind of app, including paid apps.
