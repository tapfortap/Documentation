# Tap For Tap - Self-Promotion

If you have more than one app you can use Tap for Tap to cross promote within your own apps. Choose how much of your traffic you would like to exchange with other apps on the Tap Exchange and what portion of your traffic you would like to use to self promote your other apps.

## SDK Implementation

To take park in the tap exchange, you must integrate our SDK. For more information on how to do this, see our [guide to getting started](/doc/GettingStarted).

## Promotion Banners

The banners for promoting your app are the same for the paid promotion and tap exchange.  To read about improving your banner performance, check out our [banner and creative guidelines](/doc/CreativeGuidelines).

## Self vs. External Preference

If you have more than one app, you can use Tap for Tap to create self promoting ads for your other apps. Once youâ€™ve chosen how much traffic you want to go to the Tap Exchange, you can then select how much of this traffic you want to use to self promote and how much you want to use on the exchange.

Adjust the slider to prioritize a mix of Tap Exchange vs. Self Promotion.

You can move the slider to the left if you want to focus on growing users by using the Tap Exchange, or move the slider to the right and cross promote your other apps. If you only have a few apps we recommend moving the slider more left to prioritize showing tap exchange ads.

## Country Targeting

Tap for Tap allows you to limit which countries your app gets displayed on.  This can be important if you only do business in select countries.

![Country Targeting](https://raw.github.com/tapfortap/Documentation/master/images/world-target.png)

There is an extra tap credit cost with targeting countries. You can see what the extra cost is here.  The reason for this is to promote balance on the network.  If everyone chose to target specific countries, the network would break down. Our goal is to send you taps of the same value that you have sent with our matching system. If your app mainly consists of users from a specific country would probably receive a lot of traffic from that same country back without targeting.

## Reporting

Self Promotion reporting tells you how many ads you've shown for your own apps, how many taps you've received on the ads for your apps and how many installs you've generated by promoting your own apps.
