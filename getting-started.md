# Introduction #

This guide will walk you through the process of integrating the Tap for Tap SDK into your application.

##  1. Sign Up & Grab Your API Key

If you haven't done so already, first [sign up](https://tapfortap.com/signup) for Tap for Tap and [grab your API key](/manage/apps/add).

##  2. Integrate the SDK

You need to  [download our SDK](https://github.com/tapfortap/SDK/archive/master.zip) and integrate it into each of your applications. Follow our step-by-step guides depending on what you'd like to integrate on:

- [Android](/doc/android/integration)
- [iOS](/doc/ios/integration) 
- [Unity](/doc/unity/integration)

##  3. Verify Connection With Tap for Tap

Once the Tap for Tap SDK is correctly installed, open your app. The first time your app checks in with Tap for Tap (by the *initialize* call in your code), you will get an alert message notifying you that your SDK installation was successful and that your app has been created on Tap for Tap. This alert will only appear the first time you open your app.

##  4. Take App Live on Market

Your app *must* be live and on the corresponding app market (Google Play / Apple App Store) before it can be properly configured. If your app was originally added to Tap for Tap before being placed on the app market, you should use the refresh button on the app’s overview page to grab the information necessary for configuration.

##  You're all set up!

#### Now take these steps to get the most out of Tap for Tap:

##  Placing Ad Units in Your App to Earn Credits / Make Money

To earn credits on the Tap Exchange (to exchange impressions with other Tap for Tap developers), or make money on the monetization network, you need to place ad units in your app. This will happen if you have set your Earning Preferences slider on your [account page](/manage/account) to 'Make Money' (partially or fully). This step is not required if you only wish to promote your app using paid promotion.

##  Upload Creatives

To promote your application, you will need to upload creatives. Go to your [apps page](/manage/apps), click on the app you'd like to promote and click 'Add banners'. From there you can use our simple creative generation system, or upload custom creatives for top results.

##  Get Users For Free with the Tap Exchange 

Once properly configured, you will be able to earn tap credits on the [Tap Exchange](/doc/get-users/tap-exchange) by promoting community apps.  Your tap credits will automatically spend the same value as you earn for seamless app promotion.  If you have multiple apps, you can prioritize how much promotion each app spends by adjusting the “spend priority” setting under each app.

##  Grow your User-Base Faster with Paid Promotion 

You can add money to your account balance or earn money with our [Monetization Program](/doc/make-money/monetization-network) to buy more promotion for your app with CPC campaigns.  [Paid Promotion](/doc/get-users/paid-promotion) allows you to grow your app's userbase much faster.

##  Make Money 

Make money by displaying revenue generating ads on our monetization network. Prioritize the percentage of your ad inventory you use to make money in your account dashboard. When making money with our [Monetization Network](/doc/make-money/monetization-network), we will update your balance when your application earns revenue. Every month you will have the opportunity to cash out, or you can use that money for [Paid Promotion Program](/doc/get-users/paid-promotion).
