# Introduction #

This guide will walk you through the process of integrating the Tap for Tap SDK into your application. Once you're done, check out the SDK Docs for additional information and best practices. 

##  Account Setup 

First [sign up](https://tapfortap.com/signup) for Tap for Tap and grab your API key from the top of your account page.

##  SDK Integration

Once you have your account-wide API key, you need to  [download our SDK](https://github.com/tapfortap/SDK/archive/master.zip) and integrate it into each of your applications. Follow our documentation step-by-step for native [Android](/doc/android/integration) or [iOS](/doc/ios/integration) integration. For additional help, watch out SDK implementation videos for native [Android](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDj16PJ5WQk&hd=1), native [iOS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS7DEvITf7Y&hd=1), and other non-native plugins as they become available.

If you are using one of our supported plugins (Unity 3D, Phonegap, etc.), [download the SDK package for the corresponding plugin](/doc). If you are using one of our supported plugins, please follow the documentation for that specific plugin. 

##  Trigger Initialize

Once the Tap for Tap SDK is correctly installed, open your app. The first time your app checks in with Tap for Tap (by the *initialize* call in your code), you will get an alert message notifying you that your SDK installation was successful and that your app has been created on Tap for Tap. This alert will only appear the first time you open your app.

##  Place Ad Units 

To earn credits on the Tap Exchange or make money on the monetization network, you need to place [ad units](/doc/ad-units) in your app. This step is not required if you only wish to promote your app using [Paid Promotion](/doc/paid-promotion).

##  Log In to Tap for Tap

Now that your app is on [Tap for Tap](http://tapfortap.com), you will need to configure it so you can promote it on the network. [Login here](http://tapfortap.com/login).

##  Take App Live on Market

Your app *must* be live and on the corresponding app market before it can be properly configured. Once up for sale or download (on the *App Store* or *Google Play*), you should create promotion banners (i.e. banner creatives). If your app was originally added to Tap for Tap before being placed on the app market, you should use the refresh button on the app’s overview page to grab the information necessary for configuration.

##  Upload Creatives

To promote your application, you will need to upload creatives. Use our simple creative generation system, or upload custom creatives for top results.

##  Get Users For Free with the Tap Exchange 

Once properly configured, you will be able to earn tap credits on the [Tap Exchange](/doc/get-users/tap-exchange) by promoting community apps.  Your tap credits will automatically spend the same value as you earn for seamless app promotion.  If you have multiple apps, you can prioritize how much promotion each app spends by adjusting the “spend priority” setting under each app.

##  Grow your User Base Faster with Paid Promotion 

You can add money to your account balance or earn money with our [Monetization Program](/doc/monetization) to buy more promotion for your app with CPC campaigns.  [Paid Promotion](/doc/get-users/paid-promotion) allows you to grow your app's userbase much faster.

##  Make Money 

Make money by displaying revenue generating ads on our monetization network. Prioritize the percentage of your ad inventory you use to make money in your account dashboard. When making money with our [Monetization Program](/doc/monetization), we will update your balance when your application earns revenue. Every month you will have the opportunity to cash out, or you can use that money for [Paid Promotion Program](/doc/get-users/paid-promotion).
