# Reward Moment

Rewards are congratulatory brand messages that gift a player with a reward after a moment of achievement. Rewards are NOT value exchange ads. They are implemented after an achievement moment, like getting a high-score or completing a goal. Examples of past Reward offers include: $5 off Fanatics, free travel size Sexy Hair products, and a free month box subscription to Thrive Market.


## Achievement Moment Examples

### Games

* Player obtains new high score
* Player ranks higher on leaderboard 
* Player obtains new rank or level up
* Player unlocks new content
* Player wins tournament
* Player completes chapter made of multiple levels
* Player adds a friend
* Player completes a tutorial

### Lifestyle Apps

* User beats personal best
* User completes list of set tasks
* User reaches a goal
* User unlocks new content
* User completes task X days in a row
* User adds a friend
* User completes a tutorial


## Reward Capping

Rewards should have an element of scarcity and randomness. If a reward appears after each level-up they will lose their appeal. For this reason you must strategically place reward units and cap the number of rewards a user receives each session. 

To be effective, achievement moments must be contextually relevant to each user. A best practice is to place a reward early, then increase the difficulty to reach the next achievement incrementally after each reward. Pick multiple achievement events to appeal to users of all levels and to capitalize on the reward unit inventory. 

## Moment Messaging

Customizing your messaging can optimize your application’s redemption rates. The best way to customize the reward experience is to name achievement moments to notify the user what they did to receive a reward.

If you choose you can notify a user why they are receiving a reward. This provides a more seamless user experience. If you choose to do this the reward units will have the following string: “Congratulations, here is a reward for [moment name]”. For this reason it is best to name moments beginning with a verb, such as: 

* saving Princess Peach.
* running your fastest 10k.
* unlocking a new receipe.
