# Rescue Moment

Rescue saves a user in a moment of need through brand sponsored value exchange ads. Rescue requires the player to opt-in to interact with an ad in return for in-app currency or extra gameplays. Our rescue unit inventory includes rewarded video and rich media interstitials. 

## Rescue Moment Examples

### Games

* Player fails to pass level after 2 or 3 attempts
* Player is low on resources
* Player needs a specific item to level up
* Player attempts to purchase item but is short coins
* Player runs out of time to complete task

### Lifestyle Apps

* User abandons content in cart 
* User runs out of time to complete task


## Rescue Capping

Rescue moments should have an element of scarcity and randomness. If you rescue a player after each failure they will feel over montetized and it will take away from natural gameflow. For this reason, you must ensure you are strategically placing rescue units and limiting the number of rescue units per each session.  

In order to be effective, Rescue moments must be contextually relevant to each user. This is dependant on the difficulty of your game and session depth. We are always willing to [consult](doc/support) with you to find the right those right moments for your application.

## Moment Messaging

The following message string is presented to your user directly within each Rescue Ad. Certain messages can be customized by you to provide the best overall user experience.  
 
* Rescue title asking if the player needs assistance on the opt-in panel (eg, "Need More Time")
* Rescue text that follows the brand logo on the  (eg, "Dunkin' Donuts is here to help!")
* Enticement* & Reward Text instructing the player the required engagement in exchange for a reward (eg, "Watch a short message and get another minute on the clock!")
* Reward icon to appear on the opt-in panel and the confirmation panel
* Text on the opt-in button that acts as a call to action (eg, "Click for your free time!")
