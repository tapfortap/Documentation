# Ad Units

## Interstitials


Interstitials are full screen ads that are displayed in your application. Tap for Tap's interstials are MRAID and VAST compliant, with smart pre-caching for no lag time. The interstital sizes are 640x960 (Portrait) and 960x640 (landscape).

### Moments Based Interstitials

It is our goal to provide the most contextually relevant ads that fit in seamlessly with your application. This increases monetization performance, while enhancing the user experience. Moments Based Monetization ensures that the right user sees the right ad at the right time.  These are the moments we monetize in your application:

* [__Reward__](/doc/make-money/reward-moment): congratulatory brand sponsored reward after a moment of achievement
* [__Rescue__](/doc/make-money/rescue-moment): saves a user in a moment of need through brand sponsored value exchange ads
* [__Break__](/doc/make-money/break-moment): provides custom brand messages during natural pause moment in app action

You must get approval from a member of the Tap for Tap [support](/doc/help/support) team to activate moments based interstitials into your application. This ensures moments are properly placed for top performance.


## Banners

Banners are the most basic type of ad. They can be placed at either the top or bottom of any screen within your application. If you have the real estate on your app, show banners to earn maximum tap credits.  Tap for Tap banners are MRAID compliant, can show static or dynamic images, and are sized 320x50.
