AdWhirl is on the way out and [AdMob](AdMob) mediation is on the way in. If you still use AdWhirl we have you covered!
After integrating AdWhirl [Android](https://www.adwhirl.com/doc/android/AdWhirlAndroidSDKSetup.html),
[iOS](https://www.adwhirl.com/doc/ios/AdWhirliOSSDKSetup.html))
you just need to set up a [custom event](http://code.google.com/p/adwhirl/wiki/CustomEvents)
for Tap for Tap. We have some code examples for handling custom events on
[Android](https://gist.github.com/3890004) and [iOS](https://gist.github.com/3890013).
If you run into a wall [let us know](http://tapfortap.zendesk.com) and we can give you a hand!
