# Tap for Tap - Monetization

Tap for Tap allows you to split your traffic into two parts, the tap exchange and monetization.

Tap for Tap has combined some big time advertisers, technologies and other developers on the Tap for Tap network to bring you an inventory of thousands of quality advertisements you can display in your app for money.

## Revenue Preference

Your account wide revenue preference setting determines how much of your traffic gets divided into our tap exchange and the monetization program.

You can move the slider more to the left if you want to focus on users, or move the slider more to the right for more focus on making money.

## Performance

You will receive a certain amount of revenue depending on a few factors. The main factor would be where your users are located.  Tap for Tap groups countries into [tiers](/doc/CountryTiers) which helps determine how well they should perform. Tier 1 countries generally make a lot more revenue than tier 4. You can also take [steps](/doc/AdPlacementGuide) to improve the performance of your ads to ensure proper placement and visibility.

## 100% Fill Rate

A unique feature of Tap for Tap is we will always fall back on a [tap exchange](/doc/TapExchange) ad if we cannot find a good revenue generating ad to place.  This allows you to always benefit from placing a Tap for Tap ad.

## Demographics

If you have information on your users you can greatly improve your revenue potential.  We accept four pieces of information about users: gender, year of birth, location and account id (on your system).  Providing this information both protects your users identity and improves revenue performance for your traffic.

## Optimization

Over time Tap for Tap rotates numerous apps and ads on your monetization traffic to find the best performing solution.  Overtime you can expect greater performance.

## Fraudulent Traffic

Tap for Tap takes protecting its developers and advertisers seriously. We have a zero tolerance policy for fraud.  We have seen everything from generating fake impressions and taps, to installing apps from ads to increase revenue. If you are found to generate fraudulent traffic payments will be withheld and legal action might be pursued.

## Reporting

## Beta

The Tap for Tap monetization program is still in beta.  We are confident our performance will be as good as a dedicated revenue service, we are aiming to be much better.
