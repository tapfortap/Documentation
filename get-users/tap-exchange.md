# Tap Exchange

The Tap Exchange allows you to grow your application's user base for free, by exchanging taps with other members of the community. Earn credits by showing ads for other developers, and spend those credits to promote your own app. The dynamic nature of the Tap Exchange market allows for seamless user acquisition.


In order to be active on the Tap Exchange you will need to:

1. Integrate our [SDK](/doc/getting-started)
2. Have you Revenue [Preference Slider](/doc/how-it-works) set to Get Users > 0%
3. Upload promotional [creatives](/doc/creative-guidelines) for your application


## Tap Credits

Tap credits are the currency of the Tap Exchange. By showing tap exchange ads on your app, you are promoting other developers. Every time one of your appsâ€™ users taps an exchange ad, you earn tap credits. You can then spend those credits by promoting your applications creatives on other developers ads.

The amount of tap credits you receive on a tap is directly related to the country the user that tapped on the ad is from. The countries are grouped into [tiers](/doc/country-tiers), and the tap value is assigned to that tier.

## Geo Targeting

You can control which countries your application is promoted on. There is an extra cost for targeting, to promote a balance on the network. You can find more details about targeting and tiering in [this guide](/docs/country-tiers).

## Matching System

Our goal is to ensure developers receive the same value taps they send to other community members. We examine a number of factors to determine the value of a tap including:

- User demographics (language and location)
- [Ad unit](/doc/ad-units) type and placement
- Information about the app (quality rating and category)
- Overall performance of the users seeing and tapping on ads displayed in your app

If you spend time ensuring quality ad placements for performance you will generally achieve better results. Trying to earn credits from accidental taps will result in lower quality taps being sent back. Learn more about how to improve ad performance [here](/doc/performance/placement).

## Reporting

Reporting is broken down by Earned and Spent metrics.

Earned indicates the taps credits you have recevived by showing ads as a publisher on the Tap Exchange. For example, if you show 1000 impressions of Tap Exchange ads, getting 10 taps on the ads (from a tier 1 country), you will have "Earned" 400 credits.

Spent indicates the tap credits that have been withdrawn to promote your app as an advertiser on the Tap Exchange. If you spend 400 tap credits, we will generate impressions for your app's creatives as many times as it takes for you to receive 400 credits worth of taps. Spent Installs refers to the number of new installs those taps have generated.
