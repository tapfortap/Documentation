# Paid Promotion

Paid promotion allows you to buy traffic for your app to get more users quickly.  

In order to use our paid promotion network, you will need to:

1. Download our [SDK](/doc/getting-started).
2. Set your Get Users traffic to Self Promotion > 0% and opt-in to the paid promotion program under your accounts page
3. Upload [promotional creatives](doc/get-users/creative-guidelines)


## Bid System

Tap for Tap uses a competitive bid system; the more you pay, the more traffic you receive. The performance of your app (TTR/CR*) and the quality of your app (user ratings/Tap Exchange participation) are other factors that determine how much traffic you will receive.

* TTR: Tap through rate
* CR: Conversion rate


## Paid Promotion Types

**CPC:** Cost per click. Pay every time a user taps your appâ€™s ad to engage with your app.

## Country Targeting

Targeting allows you to choose what countries your app is promoted in. The minimum cost of targeting varys based on the [tier](/doc/get-users/geo-targeting) each country is in. This is to ensure developers are earning revenue proportional to the quality and paid promotion competitiveness of the traffic their app provides. If you choose not to target, your minimum bid will be lower, but you will receive traffic from all countries on the network.

## Spend Limit

Setting daily spend limites will ensure you do not spend all of your account balance at once. The minimum daily spend limit for our program is ($10). If you leave this option blank it will not use a spend limit.

If you are using our [monetization program](/doc/monetization) as well as paying for promotion we recommend you do not use a spend limit so all of your revenue can contribute to growing your app.

## Reporting

Paid Promotion reports show how many impressions, taps and installs you've purchased from our network.
