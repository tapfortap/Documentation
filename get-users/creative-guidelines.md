# Creative Guidelines 


## Ad Units

Promotional creatives can be banners or full screen interstitials. To learn more about what types of ads we support, and how they are displayed, check out our [ad units](doc/make-money/ad-overview) documentation.

## Performance

You want to optimize your creatives for top performance. The goal is to achieve high  TTR (tap through rate) and CR (conversion rate) by picking impression placements with the most value.  This will result in better ads being displayed on your app, with you earning more tap credits. 

## Generating Creatives

Our creative generation system makes uploading promotional creatives easy! All you need to do is provide some basic information about your application. Our system will then generate creatives based on that information and screen shots of your application from the app store. Profanity is not allowed! 

### Theme

You have three options for your creative theme: light, dark and app icon colors.  Check out all three and choose the one that you think makes your creative look the best.

### Description

You have **32** characters to convey a strong message on what your app is about. Use actionable words if possible like “create ringtones” or “play now”. 

### App Name

Let people know the name of your app. Names are limited to **20** characters.

### App Price

The price of your app will automatically be placed in the creative for you.

## Custom Banners

If you have custom promotional creatives for your application you can upload them to use instead. Custom creatives tend to perform better as they give a better representation of what the app experience is like. A well designed creative can radically improve your overall performance. Just be sure to show your apps icon somewhere on the creative.
